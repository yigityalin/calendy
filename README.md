Title: Calendy: Utility Calendar

Description:
Calendy is a multipurpose calendar that allows its users to create and manage their timetables. 
At its core, calendy is composed of an annual calendar where users can add or organize various
tasks with particular properties. Users can be added to calendars, and new calendars can be
created and shared between users.

Status:
Mostly completed but subscribing to other people's calendars through search is left.

How to run:
1- Open the project with Android Stuido
2- Create a new Android Virtual Device that has Google Play (must) and is API 29 (Android 10).
3- To create AVD, Navigate to Tools -> AVD Manager
4- Preferably, run the app on Pixel 3a API 29 (With Google Play Store).
5- You may experience crashes (e.g. NullPointerException) when you launch the app and quickly navigate between menus,
that's because sometimes fetching the data from Firebase takes too long. But we rarely experienced such crashes.
